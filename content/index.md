# Hi!

I'm Ulisse Mini, I'm a programmer and math geek.

More people should worry about [existential risks](https://nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.html).

I'm currently focused on math, currently learning [probability](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Probability-Chapman-Statistical-Science-dp-1138369918/dp/1138369918), [control theory](https://github.com/UlisseMini/awesome-control) and slowly learning [tensor calculus](https://youtu.be/e0eJXttPRZI?list=PLlXfTHzgMRULkodlIEqfgTS-H1AY_bNtq).

My second priority is working on this blog, (see [drafts](/drafts.html)).

If you find mistakes in any posts, contact me or [create an issue](https://github.com/UlisseMini/uli.rocks/issues) on github.
