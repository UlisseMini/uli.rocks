# Hi!

I'm Ulisse Mini, i worry about [existential risks](https://nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.html) (primarily artificial intelligence)

I'm interested in [intelligence](https://www.readthesequences.com/The-Power-Of-Intelligence),
Building it (AI), and improving my own with [rationality](https://www.readthesequences.com/) and [augmentation](https://mnielsen.github.io/notes/engelbart/engelbart.html).

I'm currently learning [convex optimization](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/), then I'm going to write a self-contained explanation of [G-FOLD](http://www.larsblackmore.com/iee_tcst13.pdf) (a [rocket](https://youtu.be/PzHaWc5n70A) [control](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l89o7Ff6ItU) algorithm)

I also think [hpmor](https://www.hpmor.com/) is the greatest book ever.

If you find mistakes [create a github issue](https://github.com/UlisseMini/uli.rocks/issues) and I'll fix them.
