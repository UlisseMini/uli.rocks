Today

6h of math (stat110 textbook)
4.5h of coding [shika](https://github.com/ulissemini/shika)

Did not do anki or wanikani though.

Should be more focused with my projects and polish more. Maybe
I'll dedicate some coding time each day that I *must* spend working on a
pinned github repo (not starting anything new).
