Learned inclusion-exclusion, wrote a program to generate the formula for `$P(A + \dots + Z)` to overcome my fear of nested summations.

Spent 2.3 hours reading random AI papers, decided its more productive to just work through a textbook.


Learned A*, its literally just best first with `$f(n) = g(n) + h(n)` with travel distance so far `$g(n)` and heruistic `$h(n)`.

A* is cost optimal for optimistic herustic (it never overestimates).
