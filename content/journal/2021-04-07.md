So I'm learning web development and I tried to build authentication using the "old" way with forms, redirects and cookies.

This might not have been so bad except for using [fastapi](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), which really isn't made for this.

I'm rewriting it to use json & api requests with javascript now.

If you're building a website and part of it won't work without javascript, just go all in on javascript.
maintaining both is too hard.
