Did some [stat110 problems](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/stat110/files/strategic_practice_and_homework_1.pdf) I'm horrible at combinitorics but I'll get better

Learned
```tex
\sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k} = 2^n
```
You can see this in pascel's triangle, since each element doubles each row doubles. Or you can use a story.

Story:
There are `$2^n` subsets of a set with `$n` elements, another way of counting that
is sum the subsets of each length, we have `${n \choose 2}` subsets of size `$2`, etc.

This isn't obvious at first, but spend some time thinking about it and it becomes clear.


Spent an hour trying to solve [this](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-dice-rolls-with-target-sum/) leetcode question, I'm sure it'll be obvious once I figure it out. I did "solve" it with a simple recursive algorithm, but it runs in exponential time, totally infeasible for large inputs.

Spent 1.5h refactoring binder until I realized my refactor was stupid. Maybe I'll just integrate binder into minder then see what issues come up.
