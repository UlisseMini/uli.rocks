- Read some [betterexplained](https://betterexplained.com/articles/integral-sinx/) calculus
- Rabbithole of trying to compress numbers into formule, found [ries](http://mrob.com/pub/ries/)
- Learned some basic [tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com/) (trying to overcome my library phobia)
- Spent a few hours reading about compilers and reading the pratt paper
- Wrote some basic floof stuff

I would have done more but I spent 3h watching my brothers till noon.
So I skipped most of my math stuff.


Seems like learning web design/css by stealing mockups is a good idea, then I can learn just implementation, THEN learn how to design.
