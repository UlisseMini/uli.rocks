Today

Did 3h of stat110 in the morning, spent 3h on problems.

**Wasted 6h** rewatching deathnote, I've got to be more diciplined.
Maybe I'll try doing 0 distractions for a few days & get in the habit.
I can force myself for a few days on willpower but habit is needed to go longer.


Spent a few hours doing misc low-effort research on coding stuff
