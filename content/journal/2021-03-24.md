Had to watch my brothers in the morning, only got on my computer at 1

Did 1h of integrals practice
Did 2h of practicing factoring/partial fractions.

Learned how to do this integral
$$
\int \frac{1}{x^3 + 1}dx = \int \frac{1}{(x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1)}dx
$$
Then do partial fractions.

I wasted like 2h on youtube, I've noticed I usually do things in bunches, ie.
I did 3.5h of math in a row, then wasted 2h on youtube (started when eating dinner).

Maybe if I eat outside I won't be tempted to start youtube? Its pretty stupid though,
I don't get bored so I shoulden't be seeking passive entertainment.

Listened to an [interview](https://youtu.be/mLTN0xTiFa0) with scott young and betterexplained, very cool! I'm getting his book now :D
