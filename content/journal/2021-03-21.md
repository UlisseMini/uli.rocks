Spent 2h doing some integrals from [here](http://www.mit.edu/~pax/pdf/qualifying_round_2013_test.pdf) a lot of them had some easy trick, I specifically like this one
```tex
\int \log(x^2) - 2 \log(2x)dx
```
Your brain naturally wants to sub `$u = x^2` but that's wrong! you bring out the exponent
```tex
\int \log(x^2) - 2 \log(2x)dx = \int 2 \log(x) - 2(\log(x) + \log(2))dx = \int -2\log(2)dx
```
Which is just a constant!

I'm surprised you're supposed to do all those integrals in 20 minutes, I guess you get fast with practice. practice I don't yet have yet :d


Spent some time learning about multivariable taylor series, realized if you have the "components" you can series expand each one.
```tex
z = e^x + \cos(y) = \left(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n!}\right) + \left(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (-1)^n \frac{x^{2n}}{(2n)!}\right)
```

Learned how to use sympy to do series expansion
```py
import sympy as sp
from sympy.abc import x, y

z = sp.exp(x) + sp.cos(y)
z.series(x)
# 1 + cos(y) + x + x**2/2 + x**3/6 + x**4/24 + x**5/120 + O(x**6)

z.series(y)
# 1 + exp(x) - y**2/2 + y**4/24 + O(y**6)

z.series(x).removeO().series(y).removeO()
# x**5/120 + x**4/24 + x**3/6 + x**2/2 + x + y**4/24 - y**2/2 + 2
```

Found out about [dogehouse](https://dogehouse.tv) which [started as a meme](https://youtu.be/1PBNAoKd-70) but is now being made into a real company :D

I setup this journal
