Today

1h stat110 math, covariance practice problems
2h 30m tensor calculus lectures
1h coding/rust macros
2h probability question about generating functions
2h dice problem, did a bunch of dumb algebra that diden't work

I did tons of math but diden't feel like I made much progress, maybe taking breaks more would help.

For example the 2h I spent on the dice problem, I should have done what I did in like 1h or 30m. not sure where the inefficency is coming from
