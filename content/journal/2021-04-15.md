Watched number theory lecture, learned about euler's formula (for coprime n and k)
```tex
k^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod n
```
Explained [here](/p/eulers-theorem.html)


Realized I'm an idiot and should just be using data attributes instead of complicated templating things. literally this works
```html
<p data-text="username"></p>
<p data-text="bio"></p>
```
Then you do something like (untested)
```javascript
const data = {username: "foo", bio: "I like bars"}
document.querySelectorAll("[data-text]").forEach(el => {
  el.innerText = data[el.dataset.text]
})
```

SO DUMB!, this was a trap from having this in my code
```javascript
function $(id) { return document.getElementById(id) }
```
It infected my subconscious, I stopped thinking about data attributes since I knew I'd have to use `document.querySelectorAll` so I was trying to do it with ids!
