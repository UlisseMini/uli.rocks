Spent all day building my brothers new computer, I thought it would take 2h, it took 5h
Really I could have done some other stuff (eg while windows/other stuff downloaded) but I diden't,
gotta get better at working at random oppertunities, currently my schedule is fragile,
mess it up by a few hours and usually I don't recover. perhaps this is a side effect of my scheduling addiction

Things I did
- setup brothers computer (~5h)
