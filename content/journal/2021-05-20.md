Today

Finished moments chapter (took 5h 20m)

1h 30m drafted a blog about generating functions to solve the dice problem

Spent 4h messing with latex and pandoc, I've concluded pandoc is literally jesus and will be rewritting my blog shortly.

`$x^x` changes from decreasing to increasing at `$x = e^{-1}` since the derivative
```tex
y = x^x \implies \ln y = x \ln x \implies \frac{1}{y} dy = (\ln x + 1)dx \implies \frac{dy}{dx} = x^x(\ln x + 1)
```
Equate to zero
```tex
x^x(\ln x + 1) = 0 \implies \ln x + 1 = 0 \implies x = e^{-1}
```
This is cute because I watched [this](https://youtu.be/r0_mi8ngNnM) video a long time ago and a student raised this question, but now I can solve it easily :D
