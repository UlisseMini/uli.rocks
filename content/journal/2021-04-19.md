Read about alphazero some more, I really want to understand the derivation of the UCT formula.

Found [this](https://banditalgs.com/2016/09/18/the-upper-confidence-bound-algorithm/) explaination of UCT but it seems to use more statistics then I currently have.

Learned about the Cholesky decomposition `$A = LL^T`

Spent a bunch of time implementing some nice javascript [data binding](https://github.com/ulissemini/binder)

I feel like if I improve this area the rest of the code will get much easier.

Yes I'm reinventing old frameworks, Yes I'll switch to react eventually.
