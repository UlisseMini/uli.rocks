Today

Did math for 4h 30m, finished selected problems in chap2 of my [probability textbook](http://probabilitybook.net/)

Spent 1h 20m writing a blog post about the different charactaristic equations and their connections

Around lunch wasted 1.5h watching [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESXOAJRdcwQ) for the third time and writing a javascript AI to manage qflops in [paperclip simulator](https://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/index2.html)

Spent 1h 20m reading [crafting interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/), its really good!

Spent 1h 40m implementing a [doubly linked list](https://github.com/UlisseMini/cs/blob/main/pointers/linked.c) in C

Spent 3h implementing a basic [rust to lua transpiler](https://github.com/UlisseMini/rua) using the rust [syntex_syntax](https://docs.rs/syntex_syntax) crate. I was able to skip parsing rust and just go directly to generating lua code.

Writing code that operates on an AST is tons of fun, I wish I'd tried using existing parsers a long time ago. Every time I've tried to write a compiler I gave up on parsing because I wasn't motivated to learn it. (and deal with the thousands of off-by-1-errors)
