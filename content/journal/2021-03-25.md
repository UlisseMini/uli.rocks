Learned how to prove the product rule in terms of the chain rule. let `$h(u,v) = uv`. using the multivariable chain rule when `$u = u(x)` and `$v = v(x)`
```tex
\frac{dh}{dx} = \frac{\partial h}{\partial u} \frac{du}{dx} + \frac{\partial h}{\partial v} \frac{dv}{dx} = vu' + uv'

```

Did first 30 calc2 problems from [bprp](https://youtu.be/Kwyk_mteyNc) (took 6h),
Very helpful at finding my weakspots so I can fix them.

Spent 3h coding and reading about computer algebra systems, gonna finally work on one project for multiple days :d

Wasted 5h distracted, still did a lot of work somehow though.
