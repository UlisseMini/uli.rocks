Did wanikani and anki reviews

Spent 2h helping family \w stuff

Wasted 50m on youtube, watching chess memes

Watched lecture 3,4 of math for computer science, facinating game [here](https://youtu.be/NuGDkmwEObM?t=3733). It turns out all stratigies give you `$\frac{n(n - 1)}{2}` points!
I'll write a blog post once I understand it better. But the induction is magical, everything cancels out!

Lecture 4 was impressive, he showed a bunch of basic number theory from one simple puzzle about filling two buckets!
We proved a state machine maintains divisibility, and proved an algorithm for filling buckets works. I mostly knew the GCD stuff

Spent some time trying to show `$ln(2)` is irrational, supprisingly it isn't trivial (at least for me with my terrible proof skillz D:!)


Did 30 wanikani reviews that popped back up

Summery: I did 5h math and 1h japanese.
I skipped coding since I spent that 2h helping family + that wasted hour on youtube.
