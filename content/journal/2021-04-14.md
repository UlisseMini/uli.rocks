Yesterday I stayed up till 1am watching youtube, so I just installed [kgotobed](https://github.com/reb1995/kgotobed) so I'm forced to get off at 10.

I've been thinking of how I can most effectively practice web development,
since if you think about it there are a bunch of parts

(These are just the ones I could think of now)

Its hard to improve when practicing all of them at once, Maybe something like [realworld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) would help.
Implement a frontend, then a backend with the full site working all the time.

Maybe a good way to practice is
1. Take a fully working app
2. Delete part of it
3. Rebuild it
4. Compare your code to the original.
