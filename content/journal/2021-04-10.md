- 50m wanikani
- 1h 20m language learning research, setup JP keyboard and changed locale on phone
- 1h coding metaresearch, looked at freecodecamp example apps but the code wasn't good, maybe I'll try reading real apps on github for learning.
- 1h "hacking", found [an xss](https://github.com/jetli/rust-yew-realworld-example-app/issues/18) in the rust frontend for the [realworld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) example app.
- 3.5h [hackthebox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/) & watching [ippsec](https://www.youtube.com/c/ippsec/videos).


Learned how you can get how old some software is by the file created at metadata. for example
```
$ wget target.com/styles.css
$ exiftool styles.css

...
File Modification Date/Time     : 2021:04:10 20:55:15-04:00
File Access Date/Time           : 2020:12:29 19:29:40-05:00
File Inode Change Date/Time     : 2021:04:10 20:55:15-04:00
...
```


Learned how sometimes to register an account at `target.com` you need an email `user@target.com`. also email verification often isn't a thing for internal services.
