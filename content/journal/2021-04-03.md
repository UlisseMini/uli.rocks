Time summary (in order):
- 1h japanese (wanikani)
- 2h sat reading prep (old english sucks)
- 3.5h coding
- 1.5h math
- 2h trying to fix my brother's computer, wierd graphics card glitch


Learned the cool fact that
```tex
\det\left(e^{\mathbf Mt}\right) = e^{\text{Tr}(\mathbf M)t}
```

From [this](https://youtu.be/O85OWBJ2ayo) 3b1b video (at the end)

The proof is pretty easy if you've seen [this lecture](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/video-lectures/lecture-23-differential-equations-and-exp-at)

```tex
\det\left(e^{\mathbf Mt}\right) = \det\left(\mathbf Se^{\mathbf \Lambda t}\mathbf S^{-1}\right) = \det\left(e^{\mathbf \Lambda t}\right) = e^{\text{Tr}(\mathbf M)t}
```
Verifying step's (1) and (3) are left as exercises to the reader! (hint: use the series expansion for `$e^x`)

I've been trying a new "zen" mode of productivity, where I don't try as hard and I just kinda, do stuff.

most of the difficulty I've been having working is because I'd tightly schedule what I should be doing, but I'm able to work much longer if I follow my interests and don't stress over metawork.

Here's an example of what I used to do (wrong!)

*gee could I be learning this faster? what if this knowledge is useless in 10 years? should I be following resource 2,3 instead of 1? am I doing this the right way? AAAAAAA*

Here's what I do now

*hmm doing X seems interesting*, ***does X***

The only downside is tracking progress becomes harder, but progress isn't a real thing anyway, You can always go deeper, so goals like "Learn X" can easily become "Do well on test for X" which is totally different!

I'm keeping this journal partly to keep track of what I'm doing, and to share my thoughts in a better medium then twitter.
