Woke up late (alarm is 6 but I woke up at 7:40) but I have much more energy then yesterday, maybe I haven't been getting enough sleep

Did
20m anki reviews
1h 40m japanese
2h 20m integrals practice


Did this cool integral
$$
\int \frac{\ln x}{\sqrt x}dx
$$
The trick is noticing $\ln(x) = 2 \ln \sqrt x$ then let $u^2 = x$ and $dx = 2u$
$$
2 \int \frac{\ln(\sqrt x)}{\sqrt x}dx = 2 \int \frac{\ln u}{u} \cdot 2u \space du = 4 \int \ln u\space du
$$
