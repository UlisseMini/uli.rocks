Had an idea to write some js to allow json form requests, like
```html
<form method="POST" action="/api/login" json>
  <input type="password" name="password">
  <input type="text" name="username">
  <input type="submit" value="Login">
</form>
```
But how would the json be rendered? idk

I want to avoid serverside rendering since fastapi isn't made for it.

Deployed minder to minder.nerdsniper.net and setup autodeploy

Read [the hardest program I've ever written](https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/09/08/the-hardest-program-ive-ever-written/).
I'm more interested in graph algorithms now, this fits with my philosophy that you don't know when something is useful until you learn it.

Found [William Fiset](https://www.youtube.com/c/WilliamFiset-videos) on youtube, they seem to have really good videos on algorithms.


Spent an hour reading in italian

Spend way too long setting up webpack, but found https://createapp.dev which is amazing
