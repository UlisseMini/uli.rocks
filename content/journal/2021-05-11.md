Today

Did all the random variables exercises (chap4) of http://probabilitybook.net/

Finished [pratt parsing](https://matklad.github.io/2020/04/13/simple-but-powerful-pratt-parsing.html). including tenaries.
I think I have a good grasp of the algorithm now, though it still isn't in my bones I'm confident in writing a pratt parser given some debugging time now.

Spent 1h 30m distracted reading random blogs

Spent 1h reading [visual evolution statigies](https://blog.otoro.net/2017/10/29/visual-evolution-strategies/). I understand CMA-ES conceptually now, but I still haven't learned all the statistics I need to make it exact, I'll ramp up my statistics learning then.

Side note: I tried to learn parsing and CMA-ES a long time ago and gave up when I hit stuff I coulden't figure out.
this is *bad!* with a little more effort I could have understood what it was about, even if the details escaped me.
