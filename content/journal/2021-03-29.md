Spent
2h learning japanese
3h coding
1h reading SAT prep (aka hacking stupid tests)

nerdsniper's fetcher is improving, I'm thinking of fetching graph data only for popular accounts, that should be enough to estimate interests. I want to somehow fit 50M twitter users into my 64GB ssd server if possible.

I'll prolly opensource it soon too
