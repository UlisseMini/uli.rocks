Today

2.5h finished random variables chapter, learned about the binomial and hypergeometric distributions. learned how the limiting case of the hypergeometric is the binomial.
and conditioning on the binomial gives you the hypergeometric.

1h working on charactaristic equations blog post, realized there isn't a nice pattern so gave up on it.

15m edited recursion post

50m started working on spectral theorem blog post

40m cleaned up my github, deleted & archived old repositories

2h 30m [subrute](https://github.com/UlisseMini/subrute/) editing, trying to make faster with calibration. perhaps lower level fork/exec would be faster?

1h 14m coding [rua](https://github.com/UlisseMini/rua). added `loop`, `while`, `if`, `i += 1` and started adding `for` loop support.

Watched 3.5h of naruto until bed
