subtitle: Intuitive explaination of the Gamma distribution

draft: true


## TODO
* What is the gamma distribution
  - Derive PDF as a limit of negative binomial
  - Generalize factorial using the gamma function
  - Show it is the sum of i.i.d Expo$(\lambda)$ via convolution (not MGF if possible)

* Show how the gamma is the conjugate prior of Pois$(\lambda)$

* Give an intuitive connection between $\lambda$ ~ Gamma$(y, t)$ and $T_n$ ~ Gamma$(n, \lambda)$ explaining why they represent the same thing


* Gamma AND Beta? change post to introduce both?
