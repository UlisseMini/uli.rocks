This is euler's theorem (for coprime n and k)
$$
k^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod n
$$

## Key fact

The integers coprime to n, mod n forms a [group](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Group_(mathematics)).
since multiplication by $k$ is invertible (since k is coprime to n, and k is in the group). Multiplying each element by $k$ **just reorders the elements**.

Example: multiply each coprime number by $3$ mod $8$ (Remember mod is the same as the remainder from divison)

$$
\begin{aligned}
(1 \cdot 3) &= 3  &\to 3 \\
(3 \cdot 3) &= 9  &\to 1 \\
(5 \cdot 3) &= 15 &\to 7 \\
(7 \cdot 3) &= 21 &\to 5
\end{aligned}
$$

And the product is the same if each element is multiplied by $3$, since we take out as many $8$'s as we can from each term.

$$
1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \equiv (3 \cdot 1) (3 \cdot 3) (3 \cdot 5) (3 \cdot 7) \equiv 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 7 \cdot 5 \pmod 8
$$


## The Proof
If we have $\{k_1, \dots, k_{\phi(n)}\}$ being the integers coprime to n.

We know $k$ is in the set (since n and k are coprime).
if we multiply each $k_i$ by $k$ we have

$$
\prod^{\phi(n)} k_i \equiv \prod^{\phi(n)} k_i k \pmod n
$$

Because of invertibility (no overlaps/no duplicates) and closure (stays in the set of coprimes), multiplying each $k_i$ by $k$ just reorders the elements.

Now we factor out k and invert/divide by the product (which will just be another k)
$$
1 \cdot \bcancel{\prod^{\phi(n)} k_i} \equiv k^{\phi(n)} \bcancel{\prod^{\phi(n)} k_i} \pmod n
$$
So we end up with
$$
k^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod n
$$

## Proof it is a group

There are 4 group axioms we must satisfy
1. Closure: if $k_1$ and $k_2$ share no factors with $n$, $k_1 k_2$ share no factors with $n$.
2. An identity element: just $1$ in our case
3. Associativity: multiplication is associative
4. Invertibility: see below

Let $k$ be an element of the group,
we know that $\gcd(k, n) = 1$ (coprime)

Euclids algorithm implies there exist $s$ and $t$ such that
$$
sk + tn = 1
$$
(Also known as [BÃ©zout's identity](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/B%C3%A9zout%27s_identity))

Now mod out by $n$

$$
sk + tn = 1 \implies sk \equiv 1 \pmod n
$$
Therefor $s = k^{-1}$, and an inverse exists!
