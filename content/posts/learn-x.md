Reading [ultralearning](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/) I realized the best method to learning a skill varies greatly on what that skill is.

I thought I'd write a post about what I think are the best methods for the skills I'm interested in.

## Languages

***Total immersion*** is the best way to learn a language. speaking first then reading later.
vocabulary isn't normally the limiting factor.

- [Rapid language hacking](https://www.fluentin3months.com/tedx/) tedx talk


## Math

Math alternates between concepts and procedures, with different stratigies for each one.

Integration is a procedure. You learn this by doing ***many problems*** with ***rapid feedback***.

What integration represents is a concept, You learn that by understanding explainations such as [1](https://betterexplained.com/articles/a-calculus-analogy-integrals-as-multiplication/), [2](https://betterexplained.com/articles/integral-sinx/) and [3](https://youtu.be/rfG8ce4nNh0).

These can get blurred (like in proofs) but I think concept vs procedure should be kept in mind.

## Web development
I don't know the best way to study webdev yet,
the classic advice is to just build projects and learn as you go. but that has a few flaws

1. Sometimes you aren't learning much, like searching for fixes to esoteric bugs
2. Design feedback is very delayed, it might take weeks before you realize an architectural mistake

Studying good code and modifying/improving opensource programs (RMS recomends this, I haven't tried this yet)

- [Linus torvalds](https://www.brynmawr.edu/cs/resources/beauty-of-programming) The beauty of programming

I haven't figured it out yet, but I'm interested in experimenting. I'll update this when I figure it out
